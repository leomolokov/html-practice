    <title>String Elements</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Strings are called webpage Elements, which are a direct part of some other element, i.e. text paragraph. Usually it is used to change a look of text or to highlight it in a nice way.

    <p>
      &lt;a&gt; tag is one of the most important HTML elements and used to create links <a href="https://translate.google.com">Google Translator</a>. Depending on attributes NAME or HREF being &lt;a&gt; tag sets a link or an anchor.
    </p>
    
    <p>&lt;b&gt; tag allows to highlight text <b>bold!!!!</b></p>

    <p>
      &lt;big&gt; tag makes text 1pt bigger compared to a regular one. In HTML shrift size is measured in conventional units in a span of 1 to 7. An average text set by default is 3. So, the 4-sized text will look like <big>SO!!!</big>
    </p>

    <p>
      &lt;br&gt; tag sets a line break in a place where it is placed (LOL, where elseXD). Unlike &lt;p&gt; paragraph tag, the use of &lt;br&gt; tag doesn't add an empty line before a line. <br><br>

      (it was 2 &lt;br&gt; tags before this one) an example with one:<br>

    </p>

    <p>
      &lt;em&gt; tag is used to make an accent on text. An <em>EXAMPLE</em>.
    </p>

    <p>&lt;i&gt; tag sets up a <i>CURSIVE</i> text.</p>

    <p>
      &lt;img&gt; tag is used to display images on a webpage (GIF, JPEG or PNG). In needed you can an image to another file by placing it in an &lt;a&gt; container. In this case there'll be a canvas around the image, which can be deleted by adding attribute BORDER="0" in &lt;img&gt; tag.
      <p>
        <img src="images/Faze_Clan.png" alt="Faze Clan m8" height="100">
      </p>
      <p>
        In an &lt;a&gt; wrap: <br>
        <a href="https://fazeclan.com/"><img src="images/Faze_Clan.png" alt="Faze Clan m8" height="100"></a>
      </p>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;small&gt; tag makes text 1pt smaller compared to the  regular one. It's quite the same as a &lt;big&gt; tag, but reversed actually. See an <small>EXAMPLE</small>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;span&gt; tag is universal. It's used to define a string element inside a document. An <span>example here</span>.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;strong&gt; tag highlights text. As an <strong>EXAMPLE</strong> here.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;sub&gt; tag makes a subscript (below index). It's used like so: H<sub>2</sub>O.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;sup&gt; tag makes a superscript (upper index). Like so: m<sup>2</sup>.
    </p>
    <p>
      The difference between BLOCK and STRING elements is further:
      <ul>
      <li>String elements can only contain data or other string elements, while block elements can be put into other block elements, string elements and also data. In other words, string elements cannot contain block elements.</li>
      <li>Block elements are always started from a new line, while string elements aren't highlighted this way.</li>
      <li>Block elements take all the width space given (from a browser i.e.) while a string elements width equals to width of their content plus the values of spaces, fields and borders.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
