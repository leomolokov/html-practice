    <title>String Elements</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    Strings are called webpage Elements, which are a direct part of some other element, i.e. text paragraph. Usually it is used to change a look of text or to highlight it in a nice way.

    <p>
      &lt;a&gt; tag is one of the most important HTML elements and used to create links <a href="https://translate.google.com">Google Translator</a>. Depending on attributes NAME or HREF being &lt;a&gt; tag sets a link or an anchor.

    <p>&lt;b&gt; tag allows to highlight text <b>bold!!!!</b></p>

    <p>
      &lt;big&gt; tag makes text 1pt bigger compared to a regular one. In HTML shrift size is measured in conventional units in a span of 1 to 7. An average text set by default is 3. So, the 4-sized text will look like <big>SO!!!</big>
    </p>

    <p>
      &lt;br&gt; tag sets a line break in a place where it is placed (LOL, where elseXD). Unlike &lt;p&gt; paragraph tag, the use of &lt;br&gt; tag doesn't add an empty line before a line. <br><br>

      (it was 2 &lt;br&gt; tags before this one) an example with one:<br>

    <p>&lt;i&gt; tag sets up a <i>CURSIVE</i> text.</p>

    <p>
      &lt;img&gt; tag is used to display images on a webpage (GIF, JPEG or PNG). In needed you can an image to another file by placing it in an &lt;a&gt; container. In this case there'll be a canvas around the image, which can be deleted by adding attribute BORDER="0" in &lt;img&gt; tag.
