  <body>
    List is an interconnected set of individuals phrases or sentences that begin with a bullet or a number. Lists provide an opportunity to structure and systemize different data and present them in a representative and user-friendly form.
    <p>
      &lt;ol&gt; tag defines a numbered list, that means that every list element begins with a number or letter and iterates positively.
      For example. <br>
      To buy list: <br>
      <ol>
        <li>veggies</li>
        <li>fruits</li>
        <li>milk</li>
      </ol>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;ul&gt; tag creates a marked list, each element of which begins with a small symbol - marker. An example: <br>
      TO DO LIST: <br>
      <ul>
        <li>write this training webpage until the end</li>
        <li>commit it</li>
        <li>push it to github</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;li&gt; tag defines a separate list element. While the &lt;ul&gt; or &lt;ol&gt; tag sets a list type. The &lt;li&gt; tag was used in previous examples.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lt;dd&gt;, &lt;dt&gt;, &lt;dl&gt;: the three tags to create definition lists. Each list of those types begins with a &lt;dl&gt; container, where &lt;dt&gt; tag is to put in, which is creating a definition and &lt;dd&gt; tag, which sets an explanation to the created definition. The closing &lt;/dd&gt; tag isn't required because next tag tells about the end of a previous one. However, it's a good tone to close each tag possible. See an example below: <br>
      <dl>
        <dt>HTML</dt> 
        <dd>HyperText Markup Language</dd>

        <dt>CSS</dt>
        <dd>Cascading Style Sheets</dd>

        <dt>JS</dt>
        <dd>Java Script</dd>
      </dd>
      </dl>
    See the details of these tags in a CODE INSPECTION of my webpages.
