      Frames divide the browser window into separate areas located close to each other. Each of these areas loads an independent web page defined using the <frame> tag. Frames are used to divide a web page into two or more documents, which typically contain the site's navigation and content. The frame mechanism allows you to open a document in one frame from a link clicked in a completely different frame. It is also acceptable to use a nested structure of elements; this allows you to split frames into small areas.

      &lt;frame&gt; tag defines features of a separate frame on which the browser's page is divided.

    <p>
      &lt;frameset&gt; tag replaces &lt;body&gt; tag on a webpage and forms the frame structure.

    <p>
      &lt;iframe&gt; tag creates a floating frame that is placed inside of a regular document. It allows to load any independent docs into a area with given measurements.
