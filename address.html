    <h1>Address</h1>
    <p>
      An address is the path to a document, for example, a graphic file. The address is required in cases where a link is made to a web page or a specific file is downloaded. For example, in the <img> tag, the address is used as the value of the src attribute; it specifies the path to the file with the image.
