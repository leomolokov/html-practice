		<blockquote>
			&lt;blockquote&gt; This block is used to highlight long citations inside a
			document. Text marked with this tag, will traditionally be shown as a
			straightened up block with left and right tabulations (around 40 pixels)
			and also with empty spaces above and below.
		</blockquote>

		<div>
			Tag &lt;div&gt; is considered as a universal block container and applied
			in those cases, when the block elements without any additional features
			are needed.
		</div>

		<h1>
			The &lt;h1&gt;,...,&lt;h6&gt; group of tags defines text <b>headers</b> of
			different levels, which show a relative importance of a section
			(paragraph) placed after a header.
		</h1>

		<hr> &lt;hr&gt; draws a line, the look of which depends on used attributes. The line always starts at a new string and all the elements after are displayed on a next line.

		<p>
			&lt;p&gt; defines a text paragraph.
		</p>

		<pre style="white-space: pre-wrap; word-break: keep-all;">
			&lt;pre&gt; sets a block of an pre formatted text. Such a text is usually displayed  with a mono shrift and with all the spaces between words. In HTML any number of spaces going in a row on a webpage are shown as ONE. &lt;pre&gt; tag allows to avoid such a things and show text as so it was meant by a developer.
		</pre>

		The next tags are not supposed to be placed inside of a container: &lt;pre&gt;, &lt;big&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;small&gt;, &lt;sub&gt;, &lt;sup&gt;.
