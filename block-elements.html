        <blockquote> &lt;blockquote&gt; This block is used to highlight long citations inside a document. Text marked with this tag, will traditionally be shown as a straightened up block with left and right tabulations (around 40 pixels) and also with empty spaces above and below.</blockquote>

        <div> Tag &lt;div&gt; is considered as a universal block container and applied in those cases, when the block elements without any additional features are needed.   </div>
