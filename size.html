      In HTML, the sizes of elements or the distance between them are specified in pixels or percentages. A <u>pixel</u> is an elementary point on the monitor screen; it is a relative unit of measurement; its value depends on the set screen resolution and monitor size. Take, for example, the popular monitor resolution of 1024x768 pixels. A picture with the same dimensions will occupy the entire screen area. By increasing the monitor resolution to 1280x1024, we will thereby reduce the size of the image on the screen.
    </p>
    <p>
      When using pixels as values, only a number is written without specifying units, for example: width="380".
    </p>
    <p>
      The percentage notation successfully complements pixels because it allows you to link to the size of a specific element, for example, a browser window. So, if you set the width of the image to 100%, then the image will fill the entire free space of the window in width. The browser understands that we are talking about percentages if a % symbol is added after the number, for example: width="40%".
    </p>
    <p>
      Dimensions can only be specified in whole numbers. This rule applies to both pixels and percentages.
    </p>
    <p>
      Note that the size as a percentage is calculated from the size of the parent element, in other words, the container within which the element is located. If the parent is not explicitly specified, then the browser window is taken as the reference.
